# <span style="color:#4CAF50;">P3: Spam Mail Classification using NLP and ML</span>  

### 📋 **Project Description**  
Spam emails disrupt communication and pose security risks. This project implements a spam email classification system using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to identify spam and non-spam (ham) emails. The solution is deployed as a user-friendly **Streamlit** application for real-time email classification.
